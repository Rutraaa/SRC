Square Reaction Challenge
This is a simple JavaScript game where the player needs to click on the squares to get points. Each square clicked disappears, and a new one appears. 
The player has 10 seconds to score as many points as possible, and the best result is saved in the browser's local storage.

The code starts by getting references to the HTML elements that are used in the game, such as the start button, gameboard, score display, and timer display. 
It also initializes variables to store the game state, including whether the game has started, the current score, the best score (retrieved from local storage), 
and the game timer.
